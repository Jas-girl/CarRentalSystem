# CarRentalSystem
* A Car Rental System using ArrayList in Java is another practical and engaging project idea. Here's a structured approach to designing and implementing it:
* Add Cars

Add new cars to the inventory with details like car ID, make, model, year, price per day, and availability.
* View Cars

Display a list of all cars in the inventory, categorized by availability.
* Search Cars

Search cars by various filters: car type, make, model, or price range.
* Rent a Car

Allow users to rent a car by marking it as unavailable and recording the rental details (e.g., customer name, rental period, total cost).
* Return a Car

Handle the return of a car, updating its status to available and calculating rental charges.
